# data-mining

This project contains a full data mining workflow applied to a marketing dataset, beginning with loading and inspecting the data, exploring class distributions, transforming categorical variables into numerical form using one-hot encoding, and separating the dataset into features and target labels; it then applies various machine learning models—including Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Trees—followed by performance evaluation through confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores, ultimately enabling a comparative assessment of multiple classification techniques to determine which model best predicts customer responses in a marketing context.
